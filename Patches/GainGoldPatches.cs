/// the flag:
///   • not a gift            → let the original GainGold run (unchanged).
///   • gift + toggle ON       → let the original GainGold run (Dragon Fruit fires).
///   • gift + toggle OFF      → plain credit (gold + SFX + history), skip AfterGoldGained.
///
/// Because the flag is set on EVERY machine that applies the gift (sender and observers
/// alike), the outcome is identical on all clients — no Max HP desync.

/// (The toggle idea is borrowed from Jzcse's STS2Trade fork; this is an independent
